  "headline": "Switzerland’s First Production Use of Verifiable Credentials",
  "summary": "In September 2024, the City of Zug launched Switzerland’s first production use case for verifiable credentials, powered by Procivis One technology. The project used an adoption-friendly setup by extending the existing eGovernment App with an embedded identity wallet. This enabled user-friendly, secure verifiable credential use cases in a widely used app with over 10,000 users, avoiding additional adoption hurdles. Built on open standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials, the solution ensures interoperability, compliance with evolving regulations, and provides a scalable, future-proof foundation for digital public services. Procivis One is globally interoperable, enabling secure digital credentialing across jurisdictions, government frameworks, and private sector. As a result, the solution benefits Swiss public administration while extending to international stakeholders like the EU in cross-border identity management for authorities and private companies.",
